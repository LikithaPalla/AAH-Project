                 <p>Abujhmarh is a hilly forest area, spread over 4,000 square kilometres (1,500 sq mi) in Chhattisgarh, covering Narayanpur district, Bijapur district and Dantewada district. It is home to indigenous tribes of India, including Gond, Muria, Abujhmarhia, Madiya, and Halba. It was only in 2009 that the Government of Chhattisgarh lifted the restriction on the entry of common people in the area imposed in the early 1980s. Geographically isolated and largely inaccessible, the area continues to show no physical presence of the civil administration, and is also known as "liberated-zone" as it is an alleged hub of Naxalite-Maoist insurgency, the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) and its military wing, People's Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), who run a parallel government in the area.In 2007 the area was proposed as a biosphere reserve by Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India.</p>

                <div class="card_text">
                  <p>Mawphlang is a village in the East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya state in north-eastern India, 25 kilometers from Shillong. The word maw means "stone", maw phlang means "grassy stone," and is one of many settlements in the Khasi hills named after monoliths. Mawphlang was the centre of Presbyterian Church of Wales missionary and medical activity in the Khasi Hills during the 1890s. A dispensary and then clinic were established in 1878 by Dr Griffith Griffiths of Brynmawr, Aberdaron who died at Mawphlang, 22 April 1892.[2][3][4][5] After Griffiths came William Williams (missionary) who also died at Mawphlang.Mawphlang is the site of one of the Khasi Hills sacred groves.[7][8] Khasi heritage village- located in the Mawphlang district -is considered to be the hub of Khasi culture. As per digital media NewsGram, the village project is in shambles. The heritage project was started with much fanfare, but has suffered losses due to governmental apathy and charges of corruption.</p>

It was also the highest mountain in India until 1975, when Sikkim, an independent kingdom until 1948 and a protectorate of India thereafter, became a state of India. It is located in the Chamoli district of Uttarakhand, between the Rishiganga valley on the west and the Goriganga valley on the east</p> -->
